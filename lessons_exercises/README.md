# Java Naming Conventions:
- A name is a sequence of letters and numbers and _
- Names may ot start with a number
- Class names utilize Camel Case (first letter in each world is capitalized)
- Finals (constants) are completely capitalized as a stylistic convention. Thus, we use _ to separate the individual worlds.
- The list of Java reserved words can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_keywords.asp). We cannot use these words as identifiers.

# Add Comments
- Two slashes // together indicates that the rest of the line is a comment.
- Multiple line comments start with /* and end with a */. However, we should put * at the beginning of each new line.
- If a multiple line comment starts with /** instead of /*, the contents of the comment will be included in the documentation generated by `javadoc`.
